Stages of Git

working directory => in which we are making changes currently or adding new feature or code.

staging area => when you complete your code changes you use git add command to move your changes to stage area that is temporary area.

local repo => next stage after staging is local repo where all code resides and when code is committed changes from stage area becomes part of local repo.

remote repo => after committing all code in local repo we need to push the changes to remote repo that is on github. so that other team members can access new changes.


========================================================



3 methods of git reset

1) git reset --soft HEAD~1 => it will move changes back to staging area

2) git reset --mixed HEAD~1 => it will move changes back to working area

3) git reset --hard HEAD~1 => it will remove all changes from working area as well.s

by default is used --mixed like if you use git reset HEAD~1 it will execute with --mixed flag

======================================================

1) CI stands for Continous Integration and it is basically integrating modules of different developers in central repository

in automated way.

2) Continous Delivery it is basically deploying project on pre prod envrionment that is staging in automated way.

3) Continous Deployment it is basically deploying project on main production envrionment in automated way. There may be chance that most of companies do manual 

testing at Continous Delivery level (staging) then deploy on production manually.
